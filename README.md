## Intro

yeah, repo name is literally the contents

branches are the "chapters" of learned things

yeah. :)

## Branches are

 - [Master][0]: combination of everything in one page
 - [0/Hello-World][1]: Just a simple output of a string
 - [1/Basic-Functions][2]: functions()
 - [2/State-and-Lifecycle][3]: displays a clock where it ticks per second
 - [3/Events][4]: button that does something simple
 - [4/Ajax][5]: pulls data from safebooru.donmai.us (this is an api that I find simple to use, haha)
 
## Installation... (i think)
