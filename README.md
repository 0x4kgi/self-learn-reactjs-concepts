![image](images/homepage.png)

## Intro

yeah, repo name is literally the contents

branches are the "chapters" of learned things

yeah. :)

## Branches are

- [Master][0]: combination of everything in one page
- [0/Hello-World][1]: Just a simple output of a string
- [1/Basic-Functions][2]: functions()
- [2/State-and-Lifecycle][3]: displays a clock where it ticks per second
- [3/Events][4]: button that does something simple
- [4/Ajax][5]: pulls data from [Safebooru][sfbooru] (this is an api that I find simple to use, haha)
- [5/Forms][6]: simple form
- [6/Routers][7]: React Routers things

## Installation... (i think)

- Clone this repository
- `cd` to this repository on node.js cli or git bash
