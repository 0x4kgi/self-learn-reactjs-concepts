## Intro

yeah, repo name is literally the contents

branches are the "chapters" of learned things

yeah.

## Branches are:
 - Master: combination of everything in one page
 - 0/Hello-World: Just a simple output of a string
 - 1/Basic-Functions: functions()
 - 2/State-and-Lifecycle: displays a clock where it ticks per second
 - 3/Events: button that does something simple
 - 4/Ajax: pulls data from safebooru.donmai.us (this is an api that I find simple to use, haha)
 
 ## Installation... (i think)
 - clone
 - cd to this repository on node.js cli
 - `npm start`
